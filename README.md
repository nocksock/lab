# Lab

Playground for frontend experiments and prototypes using `web-dev-server`

```bash
just edit <folder> # start web-dev-server for <folder> and open nvim
just fork <folder> # duplicate folder, and ask to start web-dever-server for new folder
just new <folder>  # ... guess what this does
```

## Requirements

I didn't bother to make this setup flexible.
So you must use the following for the above commands to work - or adjust the justfile according.

- just
- kitty
- neovim
- rg
- fzf
